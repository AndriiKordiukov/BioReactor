              <h2>Why Ascorbic Acid is Poorly Absorbed</h2>
              <p>
                Do you know why ascorbic acid is poorly absorbed by the human
                body? Ascorbic acid, more commonly known as vitamin C, is an
                essential micronutrient crucial for maintaining health and
                normal bodily functions. However, not everyone is aware that the
                absorption of this vitamin in the form of ascorbic acid can be
                challenging.
              </p>

              <div class="article-full-text" style="display: none">
                <p>
                  The problem lies in the fact that ascorbic acid is a rather
                  strong acid with a pH around 2-3. When it enters the acidic
                  environment of the stomach, this vitamin is partially destroyed,
                  and its bioavailability is reduced. As a result, not all the
                  consumed vitamin C can be fully utilized by the body.
                </p> 
                <h3>So, what to do? </h3>
                <img src="/images/blog/soda.webp" alt="ascorbic acid and soda" />
                <p>
                  To improve the absorption of ascorbic acid, it is
                  recommended to take it along with baking soda. Baking soda
                  (sodium bicarbonate) is a weak base that can neutralize the
                  acidity of the stomach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The combined intake of ascorbic acid and
                  baking soda allows for the creation of more favorable conditions
                  for the absorption of vitamin C. The baking soda raises the pH
                  in the stomach, protecting the ascorbic acid from degradation.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/blog/soda-ascorbat.webp" alt="ascorbic acid and soda" />
                <p>
                  This way, the body can more effectively utilize the incoming
                  vitamin C for maintaining health. It's important to note that
                  the dosage of baking soda should be relatively small - around
                  1/4-1/2 teaspoon per one intake of ascorbic acid.
                </p> <p>
                  Excessive amounts of soda can have a negative impact on digestion.
                  Therefore, it is crucial to follow the recommended dosages to
                  achieve the optimal effect.

              <h2>The Discovery of Vitamins</h2>
              <p>
                The understanding of the importance of vitamins for human health
                came gradually. In the late 19th century, scientists realized
                that there were special substances in food that were necessary
                for normal growth and development of the body.

                <p>
                  In 1912, Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated a substance
                  from rice bran, which he named "vitamin." This discovery was a
                  turning point in the study of essential nutritional factors.

                <p>
                  Subsequently, other vitamins were identified - A, B, C, D, E, K.
                  Each one performs vital functions in the human body. For
                  example, vitamin C is necessary for strengthening the immune
                  system, while vitamin D is responsible for the absorption of
                  calcium.
                </p> 
                <img src="images/blog/the_discovery_of_vitamins_2.webp" alt="Discovery of Vitamins" />
                <p>
                  Today, we know that vitamins need to be obtained from
                  food, as the body does not produce them on its own. Deficiencies
                  can lead to serious diseases. Therefore, it is important to
                  monitor a balanced diet and take vitamin supplements if
                  necessary.
                </p> <p>
                  The discovery of vitamins was a real breakthrough in
                  medicine and has significantly improved the health and quality
                  of life for people around the world.

              <p>
                Minerals are inorganic substances that play a vital role in our
                body. They participate in the most important biological
                processes and are necessary for the normal functioning of all
                systems.

                <p>
                  One of the most important minerals is calcium. It is responsible
                  for the strength of bones and teeth, and also helps the nervous
                  system and muscles work in harmony. An adult needs to get about
                  1000 mg of calcium per day.

                  Another important mineral is iron.
                  It is responsible for the transport of oxygen in the blood and
                  prevents anemia. The daily norm of iron for men is 8 mg, for
                  women - 18 mg.

                  Magnesium also plays a key role. It is involved
                  in more than 300 biochemical reactions, supports the work of
                  muscles and the nervous system. Adults need about 400 mg of
                  magnesium per day.

                  In addition, zinc, iodine, selenium and many
                  other minerals are important. Their deficiency can lead to
                  serious health problems. Therefore, it is important to monitor a
                  balanced diet and take mineral supplements if necessary. Regular
                  intake of all the necessary minerals is the key to lasting good
                  health.

              <h2>The Synergy of Nutrients</h2>
              <p>
                To maintain health and normal body function, we need to properly
                combine various nutrients in our diet. Their interaction plays a
                key role in the absorption and effective use of nutrients.

                <p>
                  A prime example is the interaction between vitamin C and iron.
                  Ascorbic acid enhances the absorption of iron from plant-based
                  foods in the intestines. Therefore, it is recommended to combine
                  iron-rich vegetables and fruits containing vitamin C in the same
                  meal.
                </p> 
                <img src="images/blog/the_discovery_of_vitamins_2.webp" alt="nutrients synergy" />
                <p>
                  Another example is the combination of fat-soluble vitamins
                  A, D, E, K. These vitamins are best absorbed together with a
                  small amount of fats. That's why it's important to take them
                  during meals containing healthy fats.

                <p>
                  Calcium and vitamin D also
                  form an important duo. Vitamin D helps to more effectively
                  absorb calcium from food and deposit it in the bones. Thus,
                  these two nutrients work together to maintain strong bones.

                <p>
                  Understanding the relationship between various nutrients allows
                  us to create more balanced and effective diets. By combining
                  nutrients properly, we can maximize their absorption and
                  utilization by the body.
